Info page for the v02 release of the Lagrangian Backward Simulation performed 
for the Bolivia Campaign 12.2017~05.2018

- new naming of the clusters:  
DI_RA where DI refers to the clock direction where the cluster comes from e.g. 12 -> North, 3->East, 6->south, 9->west and RA is the range e.g. SR -> short range, SM -> short mid range, MR -> mid range , LR -> long range.

- time series of the influence of each cluster is [here](./conc_ts_cluster)

- map figures for each cluster are [here](./figures/geo_info_for_each_cluster)

- time series figures for each clusters are [here](./figures/time_series)

- general description for the clusters is [here](./figures/general_description)

- interactive time series of the clusters is [here](./interactive_legend.html)

please use the [issues](https://github.com/daliagachc/flexpart_management/issues)
section for comments, questions, suggestions, etc but mail is ok as well 

- SRR timeseries for each cluster and also surface (<500 magl) SRR timeseries plus their ratio can be found 
[here](./srr_sfc_tot_clus)

- figures from the manuscript are 
[here](./figures/manuscript_figures.pdf)
