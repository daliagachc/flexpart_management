# modules 
python and other code should come here. it is regarded as the backbone of the project


2021-03-20_18-30-16_: organized then  
## The Files are the following:

- [x] daily_back  
    - code to run daily back trajectories             
  
- [x] mk_available    
    - code to create the available files for running flexpart. I think it may be used in daily_back          
- [x] run_hourly_backs  
    - seems to be deprecated (?)        
- [x] __init__.py
    - import the def packages: co, fa, cf               
- [x] clustering_funs.py     
    - code for clustering (?)   
- [x] constants.py  
    - default constants. some of these might need to go to a config file            
- [x] flex_log_pol_test.ipynb/md/py/files
    - seems a broke file. maybe can be deleted
- [x] FlexLogPol.py
    - seems to be a class to cluster a logpol flexpart output             
- [x] FLEXOUT.py    
    - class used to transform rect coords into polar coords.           
- [x] flexout_test.ipynb/md/py    
    - seems like a test for FLEXOUT 
- [x] flx_array.py              
    - functions used when analyzing flexpart output
- [x] flx_out_check_alt.ipynb/md/py  
    - seems to be an exaple on how to use the class FlxOutCheckAlt
- [x] FlxOutCheckAlt.py         
    - seems to be some kind of class for checking and summing altitude. 
    - might need to be deprecated
- [x] README.md  
    - this guide
